## SCF Android Challenge

App.net Client

Create an App.net client that just lists the most recent posts from the public timeline.

1. Each post should be rendered in a table view cell, with the most recent at the top.
2. Each cell should contain the user’s avatar
3. Each cell should contain the poster’s name in bold
4. Each cell should contain the post text, and be variable height, depending on the text size

Bonus for well organized UI and/or pull to refresh

The list should scroll quickly, without dropping frames on a recent Android device
The latest publicly released Android SDK should be used
Use of third party libraries are allowed but are not required

The timeline can be fetched here: https://alpha-api.app.net/stream/0/posts/stream/global.

Feel free to use any library you want. The code should reflect how you write classes, methods, etc in a normal application.

### Finished?

Please submit back via pull request (this will create an entry on your GitHub public timeline) or email source code to ren@seeclickfix.com.
